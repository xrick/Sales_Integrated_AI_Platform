## üìã Today's Development Goals

### Main Objectives

- [X] Analyze existing slot configuration file structure
- [X] Establish slot order mapping relationships
- [X] Design customer requirement questioning system
- [X] Create structured question configuration file
- [X] Validate system completeness

### Development Background

Based on previous development logs, the MGFD system has implemented dynamic slot learning functionality, but lacks systematic customer requirement collection order. The `default_slots_enhanced.json` file contains detailed slot definitions but lacks clear questioning sequence, so we need to establish an ordered question system to improve user experience.

## üîç Problem Analysis

### 1. Existing File Analysis

**File Structure Discovery**:

- `default_slots.json`: Contains a simple ordered list of 11 slots
- `default_slots_enhanced.json`: Contains detailed slot definitions but lacks ordering

**Slot List** (in default_slots.json order):

1. Usage (Áî®ÈÄî)
2. Price Range (ÂÉπÊ†ºÂçÄÈñì)
3. Release Time (Êé®Âá∫ÊôÇÈñì)
4. CPU Performance (CPUÊïàËÉΩ)
5. GPU Performance (GPUÊïàËÉΩ)
6. Weight (ÈáçÈáè)
7. Portability (ÊîúÂ∏∂ÊÄß)
8. Boot Speed (ÈñãÈóúÊ©üÈÄüÂ∫¶)
9. Screen Size (Ëû¢ÂπïÂ∞∫ÂØ∏)
10. Brand (ÂìÅÁâå)
11. Touch Screen (Ëß∏ÊéßËû¢Âπï)

### 2. Mapping Relationships

Established slot name correspondences:

- Usage ‚Üí `usage_purpose`
- Price Range ‚Üí `budget_range`
- Release Time ‚Üí `release_time` (new addition)
- CPU Performance ‚Üí `cpu_level`
- GPU Performance ‚Üí `gpu_level`
- Weight ‚Üí `weight_requirement`
- Portability ‚Üí `portability` (related to weight_requirement)
- Boot Speed ‚Üí `performance_features`
- Screen Size ‚Üí `screen_size`
- Brand ‚Üí `brand_preference`
- Touch Screen ‚Üí `special_requirement`

## üöÄ Implementation Solution

### 1. File Creation Strategy

**Target File**: `default_slots_questions.json`
**Location**: `libs/mgfd_cursor/humandata/`

### 2. Question Design Principles

- **Natural Conversation**: Use friendly, natural Traditional Chinese
- **Example-Driven**: Provide specific options and examples to help user understanding
- **Progressive Questioning**: Ask important required items first, then optional items
- **Smart Skipping**: Intelligently skip irrelevant questions based on answers
- **Context Aware**: Adjust subsequent questions based on previous answers

### 3. Question Type Design

- `choice_with_examples`: Multiple choice with specific examples
- `choice_with_ranges`: Multiple choice with numerical ranges
- `choice_with_explanation`: Multiple choice with explanations
- `yes_no_with_explanation`: Yes/no questions with explanations
- `choice_optional`: Optional multiple choice

## üìù Implementation Details

### 1. File Structure Design

```json
{
  "slot_questions": {
    "metadata": {
      "version": "1.0",
      "total_questions": 11,
      "question_order_source": "default_slots.json"
    },
    "question_sequence": [
      // 11 questions in order
    ],
    "questioning_strategy": {
      // Questioning strategy configuration
    },
    "conversation_flow": {
      // Conversation flow design
    },
    "smart_suggestions": {
      // Smart suggestion system
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Core Functionality Implementation

#### 2.1 Priority Design

- **Required Items** (priority 1-2): Usage, Price Range
- **Important Items** (priority 3-6): CPU, GPU, Weight, Screen Size
- **Optional Items** (priority 7-8): Brand, Boot Speed, Release Time, Touch Screen

#### 2.2 Smart Questioning Strategy

- `progressive_questioning`: Progressive questioning
- `adaptive_follow_up`: Adaptive follow-up questions
- `context_aware`: Context awareness
- `max_questions_per_round`: Maximum 3 questions per round

#### 2.3 Conditional Skip Logic

```json
"optional_skip_conditions": {
  "if_budget_low": ["gpu_level", "performance_features"],
  "if_usage_simple": ["cpu_level", "gpu_level"],
  "if_portability_not_important": ["weight_requirement"]
}
```

### 3. Question Example Design

#### Usage Question (Order 1)

```
Main Question: "What will you mainly use this laptop for?"
Example Options: 
- Gaming and Entertainment
- Work and Office
- Study and Learning
- Creative Design
- General Document Processing
- Daily Internet Use
```

#### Budget Question (Order 2)

```
Main Question: "What is your approximate budget range?"
Example Options:
- Under 25K TWD (Budget-friendly)
- 25K-50K TWD (Mid-range)
- 50K-80K TWD (High-end)
- Over 80K TWD (Premium flagship)
```
